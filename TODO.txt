- CLOD algorithm adjustments
 - Calculate LOD levels required to fit clipmap grid to planet-wrapping grid.
 - Create Geometry Clipmap grid as single mesh, starting at 1x1m resolution.
 - Tesselate grid by 8-tri fan squares to avoid cracks at resolution boundaries.
 - Calculate degrees of arc per meter at circumference of planet.
 - In vertex shader quantise grid positions by degrees of arc per meter * current grid square scale.
